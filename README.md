# pp-accessibility-web-extension
Right now this is an experimental project as we investigate supporting development of our projects

Overview
Although the internet has developed exponentially and has become easier and easier to use, it still contains shortcomings. The specific issue we are addressing is the accessibility of the internet to users with disabilities. Currently, the internet has several validators which return the number of errors in a website. However, this information is only useful to the developers.

To counter this issue, our plan is to aggregate all this data to make it beneficial to the users with disabilities. We created a Firefox extension which tells the user if the visited website is usable to a variety of disabilities. If the website is determined not usable, then the user may visit the disability-friendly websites to obtain the information he/she wants. This website creates awareness to this issue and an internet that is equally accessible to all users.
